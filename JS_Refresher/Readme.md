# Javascript Refresher  

## Introduction  
    It's the language of the web, it's a programming language built to do client side programming  
    as time moved ahead it evolved to go out of browser, and server side programming was also done  
    using javascript, it lead to evolution of Node JS, Express JS, React JS, Angular.  
      
## Variables  
    It can be created using 3 keywords, var, let and const.  
    let variables have their scope globally, and is modern javascript syntax,  
    var has its scope locally and is older js syntax,  
    const is used to fix the variable during its declaration and not allow to  
    alter its value in future.  
      
## Data types in javascript  
    Javascript has data types such as  
    Numbers, Objects, String, Booleans, undefined, null  
      
## Objects  
    One of the example of object in javascript is mapping,  
    mapping is a map of key to a value,  
    intresting fact is that in javascript for a key  
    we can also put a function as a value and call it like a object.  
      
## Events in Javascript  
    Any user action can be triggered by a in-built event listener in javascript  
    ie: addEventListener()  
    we can use either alert()  
    or we can use confirm() with the eventListener(). 
      
## Note:  
    "use strict" is a way we can impose the coder to follow all the js rules  
    which are imposed, but without it coder can escape few cases which can be  
    costly in future.  
      

## Functions  
    Functions in javascript are of 2 types, arrow functions and normal functions,  
    normal function changes the definition of "this" object and it binds its own  
    this object in the scope, but arrow function on the other hand keeps the "this"  
    object definition as same as it was earlier, so that is preserved in this case.  
      
## Call Backs  
    Its invoked when a particular task is done, say we wait for 3000 ms to fire up some task,  
    so after 3000 ms the task is fired up, that task is called a call back,  
    while we wait for the call back other part of the program is not halted.  
      
    This is achieved due to asynchronous architecture of javascript.  
      
## Promise in JS  
    Promise in JS, A task is to be performed, and once that task is completed, we will be  
    running a function, this approach in JS is called as promise in JS.  
    Promise is either resolved or rejected.  
    A library called Axios returns promises in Javascript.
